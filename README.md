# Project MIAI - ETRI

## Introduction
This project was part of the 'Artificial Intelligence Research about Multi-modal Interactions for Empathetic Conversations with Humans.'  
We focuses on **Paraverbal analysis** to deeply understand human emotions and intentions and **Backchannel Prediction** research to enhance conversation engagement.
